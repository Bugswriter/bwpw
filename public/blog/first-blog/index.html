      <h2 id="welcome-to-my-blog">Welcome to my blog</h2>
<p>So today at mid night, I am writing this blog and I am very excited about it. Because this is my first blog on <a href="https://bugswriter.com">my website</a>.
I always wanted this. My own place on &ldquo;The Internet&rdquo;, where I can write whatever I want. I don&rsquo;t like getting censored.
This is the main reason why I chose to write here, instead of structuring my rant into 280 character on twitter.
Internet is an amazing place, It changed my life. I don&rsquo;t want to go deep on Internet situation.
Since <strong>this is my first blog, this is going to be completely topicless</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-deal-here">What&rsquo;s the deal here?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This blog is just a part of <a href="https://bugswriter.com">my website</a> and I have intentions to manage this website/blog my whole life. This way I can document my life and thoughts,
and people can know me even after I die.
I want to make it public, since I have some issues interacting with people and making friends. People can know me without even contacting me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have no interest in my life, well here I will also write about tech and other stuff I learn, so those articles can be useful for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe my blogs will be highly informal. If I end up in some bad day/mood. I might write some really nasty stuff. Lets hope this never happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also want to improve my English writing skills. Seems like a great way to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate writing on garbage social media platforms (<em>example - facebook, twitter, quora</em>). Here I will feel more free and my words don&rsquo;t get mixed with noise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-words-regarding-my-poor-writing">Some words regarding my poor writing</h2>
<p>I want to make this clear, I am not good with English. So don&rsquo;t expect good literature from me. I write in exact same manner I speak.
I would love to get corrected so if you find any spelling mistake or grammar mistake please <a href="https://bugswriter.com/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-inspiration-to-start-this-blog">How I got inspiration to start this blog?</h2>
<p>I visited <a href="https://stallman.org">Richard Stallman Personal Website</a> and I love it. He is my true inpiration. The way he right against non free softwares,
it motivated me to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="on-this-blog-i-will-write-about-dot-dot">On this blog I will write about..</h2>
<ul>
<li>My life</li>
<li>Free Software</li>
<li>Hate speeches for non free softwares</li>
<li>Places I might visit in future</li>
<li>Anything new I explore</li>
<li>Movies / TV shows</li>
<li>My Opinions about random events</li>
<li>It can be anything so this list is stupid</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>I will try very hard to write regularly. So please subscribe to <a href="https://bugswriter.com/blog/index.xml">RSS feed</a> for regular updates
and make sure to <a href="https://bugswriter.com/contact/">give feedbacks</a>.</p>
